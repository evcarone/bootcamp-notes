            <p> Git is a source code managment and super important; Master Branch & Personal Branch </p>
            <p> Rule: pull first, and then push your changes (get any changes; compare to your changes; then push)
                Pull down code more than once b/c the source can change a lot in the time that you're working on the changes.
                When naming repos and files don't use spaces or periods ... use dashes
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>clone: download repo to local machine</li>
                <li>add: add new files to git for source management</li>
                <li>commit: commit changes to the repo</li>
